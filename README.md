# supportTools
several supporting tools for Quantum-espresso and EPW calculation

## phononSplit.py
This script antomatically generate folders to run ph.x in several split job.

--scfFile: filename of scf calculation of pw.x
--qmesh: mesh for 3 direction, total 3 number required
--polar:need to calculate Born effective charge and dielectric constant
--njobs:number of split jobs
--nqs:number of irreduciable qpoints

these input parameters also can be read from file. The example of the input file is phononSplitInput.txt
You need to add "@" when you want to read parameters from file. For example,

```
python phononSplit.py @phononSplitInput.txt
```

The number of irreducible qpoint is required, thus, I recommend to run test calclation just for Gamma point, 
and check this value from output file of ph.x, **dyn.0.

## epwGather.py
This script gather the required information from the split phonon jobs generated by phononSplit.py. 
(Basically, for split job version of pp.py distributed in EPW package)
To run appropreately, 
```
outdir='./'
```
in scf and phonon run. In addition, 

```
fildvscf='dvscf'
```
is required in phonon input.

## hex-phononBand.py
This script calculate phonon band dispersion from spilt phonon jobs in hexagonal crystal system.
By loading "gnuplot.plt" to gnuplot by

```
gnuplot <"gnuplot.plt"
```
you can get eps file of phonon band dispersion
